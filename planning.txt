TODO:

Continue development of the service
    Try to accomplish a first stable version with the minimal requirements

---

Write tests!!!

Implement server
    - Setup all architecture then add the services execution
    - Setup automatic configuration and service execution
    *- GET request:
        Return the current model version and the last few older ones
    - POST request
        Get prediction to this input
        Train new model
        Update current model


Service implementation
    - Save and load trained models
    - Figure out how to manage multiple models
        Approach: add a argument in the perdict function to indicate which model to use
    - Save predicted data to create a new dataset
        Once the new data set reached X entries, train a new model
        Validate the trained model
        Deploy it (or at least set it up for so)
    

Setup process
    Start server
    Check if is there a model available
        If so, load model
        Otherwise, train using stored data
    Receive prediction requests
        Predict input
        Write output back
        Store predicted data
